    "about": "During High school, I had computer science as one of my subjects, where I got to learn Programming with C++ and how to give instructions to a computer by writing code. So from there, I got an interest in coding and problem-solving. I joined Masai School in Nov 2021 which has the best intense and immersive curriculum when it comes to web development. Now, I proudly state that I am a Full Stack Web Developer pursuing MERN stack who is enthusiastic, aspiring, analytical and detail-oriented. I'm capable of working with interdisciplinary teams and executing goal-oriented projects and having the required technical skills to write codes using HTML, CSS, React and JavaScript from the front-end stack applications also NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB from the back-end stack applications. I am passionate about coding and strongly interested in obtaining a Software Developer position to work on enhancing the product experience.",
